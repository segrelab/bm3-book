# A Note about FBA Units

## How to translate media units to flux units

Straight up use the concentration of the media

The units are kind of arbitraty at some point, the relative magnitude is most importnat at some point

Just use the concentrations

All the fluxes are in micromolar per your favorite unit of time

Unless you actually have specific uptake fluxes, use that

Just pick a unit of concentration that makes your numbers look nice

Only talk about relative nubers

## Daniel's thoughts
The only thing you can confidently say is that the cells cannot use the whole media's amount in one hr

Have to think of the time unit over which it is taken up

You have the MM in COMETS that converts the concentation into the flux
Can do a rough estimate of the Vmax and the Km to get in the order of magnitude

Some of the old literature omparing to chemostat experriments can use that actual numbers

Do culutures in a box and see how much actual O2 is there and is taken up

There are a ton of people who don't set any uptake bnounds bc its hard
