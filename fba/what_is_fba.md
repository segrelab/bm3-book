Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is one approach for using GEMs to simulate the growth of organisms in diverse environments, 
and has become an essential tool for developing testable hypotheses about an organism's metabolic function. More
specifically, **FBA is a mathematical approach for analyzing the flow of metabolites through a metabolic network**.

Our GEM contains all the known metabolic reactions in an organism and the genes that encode each enzyme. We can then use
FBA to calculate the flow of metabolites through this metabolic network, thereby making it possible to predict the 
growth rate of an organism or the rate of production of a biotechnologically important metabolite.

In this article we hope to give you an intuitive understanding of how FBA works by pplying it to predict the maximum 
growth rate of Escherichia coli in the presence and absence of oxygen.
