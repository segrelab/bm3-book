# The Becoming a Microbiome Metabolic Modeler (BM3) Live Textbook

Here we have compiled and expanded upon the existing reources to learn the theory and practice of metabolic modeling, with a specific focus on modeling
microbial communities.

With these resources, we aim to provide training and resources to prepare scientists (of all backgrounds) to apply genome-scale metabolic modeling in
microbiome studies.
