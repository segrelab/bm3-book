# Linear Programming

## Constrained Optimization
Lots of times in math functions are unconstrained, meaning they either have no boundaries, or the boundaries are soft. 

However, here we will be examining situations that involve constraints.
A constraint is a hard limit placed on the value of a variable, which prevents us from going forever in certain directions.

With nonlinear functions, the optimum values can either occur at the boundaries or between them.

But, with With linear functions, the optimum values can only occur at the boundaries.

In metabolic modeling, we often do constrained optimization of linear functions. This is 
because...

### Examples of Constraints
If you are attempting to maximize the objective function, typical constraints might involve time, money, and resources. The amounts of these things are limited, and these limits also place limits on the best possible value of the objective function. 

If you are attempting to minimize, the constraints are more particular to the situation. 

### Writing Constraints
Recall from Algebra that if a single gizmo costs $4, then two gizmos cost $8, five gizmos cost $20, and g gizmos cost 4g. 
If you buy g gizmos at $4 and s sprockets at $2, then your total cost will be 4g + 2s. 
If you only have $70 to spend at the gizmo-and-sprocket store, then your total cost must be 
4g + 2s â‰¤ 70.
