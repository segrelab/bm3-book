# Numerical Solution

# Example
Suppose a company manufactures different electronic components for computers. Component A requires 2
hours of fabrication and 1 hour of assembly; component B requires 3 hours of fabrication and 1 hour of assembly,
and component C requires 2 hours of fabrication and 2 hours of assembly. The company has up to 1,000 labor
hours for fabrication and 800 labor-hours of assembly time each week. If the profit on each component A, B, and
C is $7, $8, $10 respectively, how many of each should be produced to maximize profit?
