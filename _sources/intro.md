# Introduction

Here we have compiled and expanded upon the reources listed in  "Enhancing Microbiome Research through Genome-Scale Metabolic Modeling" by Ankrah et al.

With these resources, we aim to provide training and resources to prepare scientists (of all backgrounds) to apply genome-scale metabolic modeling in microbiome studies.

The `Educational Prerequisites` section aim to fill the knowledge gaps for researchers of different backgrounds.

The `Programming` and `Representing Biology with Math` sub-sections  may be more helpful for researchers with a biological background, where the `Biochemistry` and `Microbiology` sections may be helpful to computational researchers that do not have a biological background.

The following sections (`Ecology` - `Simulations` ) are resources that will be helpful for all researchers, regardless of background.

Feel free to skip around to whatever section is the most useful to you!
