# Fundamentals

<!--- Comic idea: A joke about a murderer or sth having an M.O.--->
This section will review the fundamentals of mathematical optimization.

## So, what is mathematical optimization anyway?
“Optimization” comes from the same root as “optimal”, which means best. When you 
optimize something, you are “making it best”. 

But “best” can vary. If you’re a football player, you might want to **maximize** your running yards, and also **minimize** your fumbles. Both maximizing and minimizing are types of optimization problems.

Mathematical optimization is a branch of applied mathematics that is useful in many different fields, including biology.
In biology, mathematical optimization can be used to:

## Optimization Vocabulary
Your basic optimization problem consists of…
* The **objective function**, $f(x)$, which is the output you’re trying to maximize or minimize.
* Variables, $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$ and so on, which are the inputs – things you can control. They are abbreviated $x_n$ to refer to individuals or $x$ to refer to them as a group (also called a set).
* Constraints, which are equations that place limits on how big or small some variables can get.
  * Equality constraints are usually noted $h_n(x)$
  * Inequality constraints are noted $g_n(x)$

Let's use this vocabulary to describe a real world optimization problem.
A football coach is planning practices for his running backs.
* His main goal is to maximize running yards – this will
become his objective function.
* He can make his athletes spend practice time in the weight
room; running sprints; or practicing ball protection. The
amount of time spent on each is a variable.
* However, there are limits to the total amount of time he
has. Also, if he completely sacrifices ball protection he may
see running yards go up, but also fumbles, so he may place
an upper limit on the amount of fumbles he considers
acceptable. These are constraints.
Note that the variables influence the objective function and
the constraints place limits on the domain of the variables.

## Types of Optimization Problems
Types of Optimization Problems
* Some problems have constraints and some do not.
* There can be one variable or many.
* Variables can be discrete (for example, only have integer
values) or continuous.
* Some problems are static (do not change over time) while
some are dynamic (continual adjustments must be made as
changes occur).
* Systems can be deterministic (specific causes produce specific
effects) or stochastic (involve randomness/ probability).
* Equations can be linear (graph to lines) or
nonlinear (graph to curves)
