# Other Models

| Type | When is it good | Pros | Cons|
| ---- | --------------- | --- | --- |
| Generalized Lotka-Voltera Models | Clean solutions of super simplified system |On some timescales these parameters do even out to a constant | Doesn't explicitly model the resources,  constant parameters are not realistic, can underestimate mutualism|
| Generalized consumer-resource model | You're a theoritician | | |
| Trait-based models | |
| Individual-based models| | | Individuals grow linearly, populations grow exponentially (its an emergent characterisitic)|
| Genome-scale metabolic models | | | No regulation |

Agent or population based
Homogenous vs spatially structured
Consumer resource vs ???
Determinisitc vs stochastic
